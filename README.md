Front-End task
Sir,
I could not finish the work within the timeline. This is how far i have gone in code. I have done upto creating a form clicking on the edit button. Only i could not fill up the form with the data of the specific person clicked on due to shortage of time and knowledge both.
Thank you for giving me an opportunity. I will be more than ready for the next time In Shaa Allah.

How to run the code:
1. Download the html and css file from the repisotory.
2. Open both the file.
3. Run the html file.
4. Click the edit button in the table row under " Action ".
5. A form will come up.
